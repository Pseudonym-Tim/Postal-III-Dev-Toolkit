# Postal3Devtoolkit
This is a little "toolkit" I compiled together in one convenient bundle for people who are into Postal 3 modding, but intended mainly for Catharsis Reborn testers. It includes: A copy of the Postal 3 SDK, an overhauled debugging menu (debugsystemui panel), and some useful batch scripts. 


To install the debugging menu overhaul, copy and replace the DebugOptions.txt to (root)/core/scripts and overwrite. Call the menu by typing "debugsystemui" in the console.
